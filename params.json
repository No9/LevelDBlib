A helper class is provide with this project.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n* Clone the project\r\n* Import in Eclipse\r\n* Compile with NDK\r\n* Use LevelDB Android as Library in your project\r\n\r\n### Features of LevelDB\r\n* Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays.\r\n* Data is stored sorted by key.\r\n* Callers can provide a custom comparison function to override the sort order.\r\n* The basic operations are Put(key,value), Get(key), Delete(key).\r\n* Multiple changes can be made in one atomic batch.\r\n* Users can create a transient snapshot to get a consistent view of data.\r\n* Forward and backward iteration is supported over the data.\r\n* Data is automatically compressed using the Snappy compression library.\r\n* External activity (file system operations etc.) is relayed through a virtual interface so users can customize the operating system interactions.\r\n* Detailed documentation about how to use the library is included with the source code.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n* This is not a SQL database. It does not have a relational data model, it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.\r\n* Only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a particular database at a time.\r\n* There is no client-server support builtin to the library. An application that needs such support will have to wrap their own server around the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
